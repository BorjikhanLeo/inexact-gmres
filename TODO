* add the reason for not using preconditioner at the beginning of result section
* delete LaplaceBEM speed-up vs # iter plot, speed-up vs p_init plot, add speed-up tolerance plot for LaplaceBEM and StokesBEM, and write a paragraph to describe the plot
* fix bibtex
* check any other red comments on my notes
* check if I missed any parameters
* check abstract & conclusion after final review
